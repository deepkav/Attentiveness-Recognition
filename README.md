# Attentiveness-Recognition
Capstone Project On Attentiveness Recognition in Online Classes

We have designed a tool that would essentially pick up each studentâ€™s emotions throughout the whole online class and calculate a percentage for how attentive the student has been based on multiple parameters. At the end of the class, the teacher would get an auto-generated report about their students.

This Repo will be updated soon with all the features and parameters that we used to implement attentiveness Recognition
